# **Installation**

In order to install balooProxy simply download the [latest version of balooProxy](https://github.com/41Baloo/balooProxy/releases). You can either use a pre-configured `config.json` or configure your proxy when running it for the first time without a `config.json`.

## **Configuration**
---

The `config.json` allows you to change several features and values about balooProxy. There are three main fields, `proxy`, `domains` and `rules`.

### **Proxy**
---

This field specifically allows you to change general settings about balooProxy

### `cloudflare` <sup>Bool</sup>

If this field is set to true balooProxy will be in cloudflare mode. 
(**NOTE**: `SSL/TLS encryption mode` in your cloudflare settings has to be set to "`Flexible`". Enabeling this mode without using cloudflare will also not work. Additionally, some features, such as `TLS-Fingerprinting` will not work and always return "`Cloudflare`")

### `maxLogLength` <sup>Int</sup>

This field sets the amount of logs entires shown in the ssh terminal

### `secret` <sup>Map[String]String</sup>

This field allows you to set the secret keys for the `cookie`, `js` and `captcha` challenge. It is highly advised to change the default values using [a tool](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=20&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new) to generate secure secrets

### `ratelimits` <sup>Map[String]Int</sup>

This field allows you to set the different ratelimit values

**`requests`**: Amount of requests a single ip can send within 2 minutes

**`unknownFingerprint`**: Amount of requests a single unknown fingerprint can send within 2 minutes

**`challengeFailures`**: Amount of times a single ip can fail a challenge within 2 minutes

**`noRequestsSent`**: Amount of times a single ip can open a tcp connection without making http requests

### **Domains**
---

This field specifically allows you to change settings for a specific domain

### `name` <sup>String</sup>

The domains name (For example `example.com`)

### `scheme` <sup>String</sup>

The scheme balooProxy should use to communicate with your backend (Can be `http` or `https`. Generally you should use `http` as it is faster and less cpu intensive)

### `backend` <sup>String</sup>

Your backends ip (**Note**: You can specify ports by using the following format `1.1.1.1:8888`)

### `certificate` <sup>String</sup>

Path to your ssl certificate (For example `server.crt` or `/certificates/example.com.crt`)

### `key` <sup>String</sup>

Path to your ssl private key (For example `server.key` or `/keys/example.com.key`)

### **Rules**
---

Refer to [Custom Firewall Rules](#Custom-Firewall-Rules)

# **Custom Firewall Rules**

Thanks to [gofilter]("https://github.com/kor44/gofilter") balooProxy allows you to add your own firewall rules by using a ruleset engine based on [wireguards display filter expressions](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection.html)

## **Comparison Operatos**
---

Check if two values are identical

`eq`, `==`
```
(http.path eq "/")

(http.path == "/")
```


Check if two values are not identical

`ne`, `!=`
```
(http.path ne "/")

(http.path != "/")
```


Check if the value to the left is bigger than the value to the right

`gt`, `>`
```
(proxy.rps gt 200)

(proxy.rps > 200)
```


Check if the value to the right is bigger than the value to the left

`lt`, `<`
```
(proxy.rps lt 10)

(proxy.rps < 10)
```


Check if value to the left is bigger or equal to the value to the right

`ge`, `>=`
```
(proxy.rps_bypassed ge 50)

(proxy.rps_bypassed >= 50)
```


Check if value to the right is bigger or equal to the value to the left

`le`, `<=`
```
(proxy.rps_bypassed le 50)

(proxy.rps_bypassed <= 50)
```

## **Logical Operators**
---

Require both comparisons to return true

`and`, `&&`
```
(http.path eq "/" and http.query eq "")

(http.path eq "/" && http.query eq "")
```


Require either one of the comparisons to return true

`or`, `||`
```
(http.path eq "/" or http.query eq "/alternative")

(http.path eq "/" || http.query eq "/alternative")
```


Require comparison to return false to be true

`not`, `!`
```
!(http.path eq "/" and http.query eq "")

not(http.path eq "/" && http.query eq "")
```

## **Search / Match Operators**
---


Returns true if field contains value

`contains`
```
(http.user_agent contains "chrome")
```


Returns true if field matches a regex expression

`matches`
```
(http.header matches "(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\W)")
```

## **Structure**
---

Firewall rules are build in the `config.json` and have the following structure

```
"rules": [
        {
            "expression": "(http.path eq \"/captcha\")",
            "action": "3"
        },
        {
            "expression": "(http.path eq \"/curl\" and ip.bot eq \"Curl\")",
            "action": "0"
        }
    ]
```

Every individual has to have the `expression` and `action` field.

## **Priority**
---
Rules are priorities from top to bottom in the `config.json`. A role has priority over every rule coming after it in the json.

(**Note**: As will later be described, some rules will stop balooProxy from checking for other matching rules. This is why it is recommended to have rules with higher `action` values be higher in the json aswell.)

## **Actions**
---

The resulting action to a rule is decided based on the `"susLv"`, which is a scale from `0`-`3` how suspicious/malicious the request is. The `susLv` itself starts of at the current `stage` balooProxy is in. This is normally `1` but might change to `2` and `3` depending on how many bypassing requests balooProxy currently experiences.

Each number has its own reaction.

### `0` <sup>Allow</sup>

The request is whitelisted and will not be challenged in any form

### `1` <sup>Cookie Challenge</sup>

The request will be challenged with a simple cookie challenge which will be passed automatically by most good bots

### `2` <sup>JS Challenge</sup>

The request will be challenged with a javascript challenge which will stop most bots, including good once

### `3` <sup>Captcha</sup>

The request will be challenged with a visual captcha. The user will have to input text he sees on a picture. Will stop most malicious requests aswell as good bots

### `4 or higher` <sup>Block</sup>

Every request with a susLv of 4 or higher will be blocked

## **Adding Actions**
---
You can set a rules action to be a specific action by setting it's `action` to a specific number 

(**Note**: If a rule matches a request and sets the `action` to a specific number balooProxy will not check for other matching rules. Hence you should usually give rules with a higher `action` value a lower `priority` value aswell).

```
{
    "expression": "(http.host contains \":\")",
    "action": "3"
}
```

In this example, the rule checks whether or not the request is made by a socket and if so, challenges the request with a captcha.
***

You can also set actions more dynamically by using a `+` in front of the `action` value. This will tell balooProxy that you want to increase the *current* susLv of the request by the amount specified after the `+`.

(**Note**: actions that use a `+` do not stop balooProxy from checking if further rules match, if the rule matches. This allows you to stack multiple checks ontop of each other and set reactions more dynamically and react less aggressively when not attacked)

```
{
    "expression": "(http.engine eq \"\")",
    "action": "+1"
}
```

In this example, the rule checks whether or not the request is made by a known browser. If not, the `susLv` gets raised by `1`.

# **Custom Cache Rules**

Similar to `Custom Firewall Rules`, you can make custom cache rules in order to control what content is temporarily stored on balooProxy (for 2 hours), to make content delivery faster. The same `fields` are able to be used, however actions are different.

## **Cache Actions**
---

### `BYPASS`

Do not cache and ignore following cache rules that match the request

### `DEFAULT`

Use `Path` + `Query` + `Method` as cache-key. Best general action to cache content

### `DEFAULT_STRICT`

Use `Path` + `Query` as cache-key. Be carefull using this, as it might expose private data when used incorrectly

### `CAREFUL`

Use `IP` + `Path` + `Query` + `Method` as cache-key. Same as `DEFAULT` but bound to `IPs` aswell

### `CAREFUL_STRICT`

Use `IP` + `Path` + `Query` as cache-key. Same as `DEFAULT_STRICT` but bound to `IPs` aswell

### `IGNORE_QUERY`

Use `Path` as cache-key. Ignoring `Querys` and random `Query` spam. `POST` requests will still "bypass" this, as `POST` requests are excluded from cache

### `QUERY`

Use `Query` as cache-key. The same `Query` for different `Paths`/`Methods` will return the same result

### `CLIENTIP`

Use `IP` as cache-key. The same `IP` will always get the same result

# **Terminal**

## **Main Hud**
---

The main hud shows you different information about your proxy

### `cpu`

Shows you the current cpu usage of the server balooProxy is running on in percent

### `stage`

Shows you the stage balooProxy is currently in

### `stage locked`

Shows `true` if the stage was manually set and locked by using the `stage` command in the terminal

### `total`

Shows the number of all incoming requests per second to balooProxy

### `bypassed`

Shows the number of requests per second that passed balooProxy and have been forwarded to the backend

### `connections`

Shows the current amount of open L4 connections to balooProxy

### `latest logs`

Shows information about the last requests that passed balooProxy (The amount can be specified in `config.json`)

## **Commands**
---

The terminal allows you to input commands which change the behaviour of balooProxy

### `add`

The command `add` prompts you with questions to add another domain to your proxy (**Note**: This can be done in the config.json aswell, however that currently requires your proxy to restart to apply the changes)

### `domain`

The command `domain` followed by the name of a domain allows you to switch between your domains

### `stage`

The command `stage` followed by a number will set the proxies stage to said number
(**Note**: Setting the `stage` manually means the proxy will remain in that `stage` no matter what. Even if an attack is ongoing that bypasses this `stage`. Setting your `stage` to `0` will set the `stage` to 1 and enable automatic stage-switching again. Setting the `stage` to a number higher than `3` will result in all requests getting blocked)
